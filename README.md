This repo will contains a bunch of docker-compose files for self-hosting services.
I will try to keep them as simple as possible, with minimal dependencies.
The goal is to provide a simple way to self-host services, handling 100 users or less. (Can be lot more, tweak ressources as needed)
Feel free to open issues or PRs if you have suggestions or improvements.

# Services
- Matrix Synapse (with Postgres, Element Web, and Eturnal TURN server)
